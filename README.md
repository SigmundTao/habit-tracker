## What I Learned

Building this project taught me:

- **Data Structure Design**: Organizing nested habit data (year â†’ month â†’ days)
- **LocalStorage Management**: Persisting complex data structures
- **Date Manipulation**: Working with JavaScript Date API for calendars
- **State Management**: Keeping UI in sync with data changes
- **Streak Logic**: Implementing consecutive day counting algorithms
- **View Synchronization**: Maintaining data consistency across multiple views
- **DOM Manipulation**: Dynamic rendering of calendar grids
- **Event Delegation**: Efficient event handling for multiple checkboxes
---

## Development Notes

**Timeline**: Built in 10 days (Oct 10-20, 2025)

**Development Process**:
- Days 1-3: Initial design and week view implementation
- Days 4-6: Added yearly view and refactored data structure
- Days 7-8: Implemented streak counter with flame icons
- Days 9-10: Bug fixes, UI polish, and documentation

**Code Quality**:
- Vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks)
- No external dependencies
- Commented code for clarity
- Modular function structure

---

## Known Issues

- Streak counter doesn't persist across multiple devices (localStorage is device-specific)
- Year view doesn't handle habits created mid-year gracefully
- No data export functionality yet

*These will be addressed in v2.0*
